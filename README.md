# SwitchCaseDemo

This Java project demonstrates the use of the `switch` case structure, which allows you to select one of many code blocks to be executed based on the value of a variable. The project covers basic switch case usage and compares it to `if-else` for readability and efficiency in certain scenarios.

## Key Features:
- Demonstrates the use of `switch` case to manage multiple conditions
- Provides clear examples of how to use `switch` with integer and string values
- Compares `switch` case with `if-else` for cleaner code

## Usage:
Run the main class and observe how the program behaves based on different input values for switch cases. Modify the input to test how switch structures work in various scenarios.

## Technologies Used:
- Java
